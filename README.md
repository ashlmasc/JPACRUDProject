# JPACRUDProject

The JPACRUDProject is a Java-based web application that demonstrates the effective use of the Java Persistence API (JPA) within a Spring Boot framework to manage a database for tracking the restoration of a 1972 Mustang. This application showcases basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a user-friendly web interface, specifically tailored for a classic car restoration project.

## Description

JPACRUDProject is designed to allow users to interact with the Mustang restoration database through intuitive web-based CRUD operations. The application highlights the seamless integration of JPA with Spring Boot, enabling efficient data manipulation and management within a MySQL database environment.

The database is structured to record various aspects of the 1972 Mustang's restoration, including parts, labor, costs, suppliers, and overall progress. This detailed tracking facilitates a comprehensive overview and management of the restoration project from start to finish.

### Key Features:

- **Create**: Users can add new entries, such as parts or labor costs, to the database.
- **Read**: The application allows for detailed viewing of specific entries, providing insights into various restoration aspects.
- **Update**: Existing database records can be updated to reflect changes or progress in the restoration process.
- **Delete**: Unneeded records can be removed from the database, maintaining its accuracy and relevance.
- **Web Interface**: The web interface is designed for ease of use, ensuring that users can efficiently manage and track the restoration details.

The JPACRUDProject exemplifies the practical application of the Java Persistence API (JPA) in conjunction with the Spring MVC framework to efficiently manage and manipulate database operations within a web application. Focused on the unique context of a classic car restoration project, this application highlights the seamless integration of JPA for data handling with the robust capabilities of Spring MVC, facilitating an intuitive web-based platform for tracking the restoration of a 1972 Mustang.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language of the project.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the development of new Spring applications through convention over configuration. It provides embedded server and configuration options to enhance development productivity.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Used for mapping Java objects to database tables and managing database operations.
- **MySQL**: The database management system used for storing and retrieving data for tracking the restoration project.
- **HTML/CSS**: Employed for structuring and styling the web interface, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Generates dynamic web content by integrating server-side Java with HTML, enhancing the application's interactivity.
- **Gradle**: The build tool for managing dependencies and automating the project build process.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and project repository hosting.
- **IDE**: Spring Tool Suite 4 used for its integrative development tools.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of JPACRUDProject, several key insights were gained, including:

- **JPA and Spring Boot Integration**: Mastering the setup and interaction between JPA entities and the Spring MVC framework.
- **CRUD Operations in Web Applications**: Implementing and refining CRUD functionalities for managing complex data related to car restoration.
- **Database Design for Restoration Tracking**: Developing a focused database schema that effectively supports the tracking of a classic car restoration project.
- **User-Friendly Web Interfaces**: Creating web interfaces that cater to non-technical users involved in car restoration projects.
- **Project Deployment**: Experiencing the deployment process of a web application, including database setup and application hosting.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on AWS, demonstrating the process of deploying a Spring MVC and JPA integrated application to a cloud environment.
